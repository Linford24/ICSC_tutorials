    "## FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, there's a syntax for writing functions which is very similar to functions in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the f(x) notation is used where,\n",
    "  f = function\n",
    "  x = input of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, f performs an activity using a tool called x.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if f(x) = 2x + 5, then\n",
    "  f performs an activity which involves multiplying the tool x by 2 and adding the result to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If x = 3, thus, the tool is specified as 3 then,\n",
    "  f(3) would mean f performs an activity/function which \n",
    "  multiplies 2 by 3 and adds the result to 5\n",
    "  => 2 * 3 + 5 \n",
    "  => 6 + 5\n",
    "  = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "  finally, f(3) = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "The same example can be replicated with g(x, y) = 2y + 3x\n",
    " If g(3, 4)\n",
    " => 2 * 4 + 3 * 3\n",
    " => 8 + 9\n",
    " = 17\n",
    "\n",
    " g(x, y) = 17\n",
    "\n",
    " This same principle is applied in wrting functions in computer programming.\n",
    " f(x) = 2x + 5 can be written in code as:\n",
    " def f(x):\n",
    "    return 2*x + 5\n",
    "\n",
    " f(3) would return the same answer 11.\n",
    "\n",
    " g(x,y) can be written as:\n",
    " def g(x, y):\n",
    "    return 2 * y + 3 * x\n",
    "\n",
    " g(3, 4) would return 17 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    " Functions in programming differ from functions in mathematics by a few features:\n",
    " def, : and return\n",
    "\n",
    " For every function in programming, it starts with\n",
    " def followed by the name of the function...suppose we want to change f(x) to myfirstfunction(x), we would write this:\n",
    "\n",
    " def myfirstfunction(x) follwed by a colon which tells the computer to pay attention to what follows..just as colon is used in English to add another piece of a sentence to the first part, it is used the same way in prograaming. The colon allows the programmer to define the instructions/activity he/she wants the function to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    " def myfirstfunction(x):\n",
    "    2 * x + 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "the function above is correct but would not show us the answer unless 'return' is added to the expression in after the colon. \n",
    "It's similar to paying your school fees and not requesting for a receipt. The fees have already been paid but the receipt to show as confirmation wouldnt be with you because you never requested for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, when we call the function, myfirstfunction(x)...\n",
    "\n",
    "calling a function is a programming jargon for running the code in a function and it is done by writing the function name and valid arguments... arguments refer to the inputs you put into function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the argument for myfirstfuntion(x) is x, those for g(x, y) are x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the function definition below..\n",
    "\n",
    "  def myfirstfunction(x):\n",
    "      2 * x + 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "myfirstfunction(10)...which is the same as myfirstfunction(x = 10) would go through this process:\n",
    "  => 2 * 10 + 5\n",
    "  => 20 + 5\n",
    "  = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "  And the final result 25 would be stored in the computer's memory but never displayed like the receipt you never asked for.\n",
    "To display the result, there is the need to add 'return' command to the activity being performed. Thus,\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def myfirstfunction(x):\n",
    "      return 2 * x + 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, myfirstfunction(10) goes through this process\n",
    "  => 2 * 10 + 5\n",
    "  => 20 + 5\n",
    "  = 25\n",
    "  return 25\n",
    "So 25 gets printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another example of function. We will name this function myfullname and it takes two arguments, firstname and surname and returns a new variable called fullname.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a custom name a user gives to any data type. We have already mentioned the main data types in python programming are:\n",
    " string, integer, float, list, dictionaries, tuples, boolean (True/ False) and comparison operators.\n",
    "\n",
    " So a variable name can be given to any of these names. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable assigned to strings\n",
    "     myname = \"Linford\"\n",
    "     myschoolnumber = \"BV241\"\n",

    "\n",
    " def myfullname(firstname, surname):\n",
    "     fullname = firstname + surname\n",
    "     return fullname\n",
    "\n",
    "In this function called myfullname which takes two arguments, firstname and surname, we are creating a new variable called fullname which adds firstname to surname and assigns the results to fullname. Then we finally return fullname.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same function can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfullname(x, y):\n",
    "    z = x + y\n",
    "    return z\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the function, myfullname(\"Elon\", \"Musk\") would go through this process,\n",
    " => myfullname(firstname=\"Elon\", surname=\"Musk\")\n",
    " => fullname = firstname + surname\n",
    " => where firstname=\"Elon\", surname=\"Musk\"\n",
    " => fullname = \"Elon\" + \"Musk\"\n",
    " => fullname = \"ElonMusk\"\n",
    " finally the myfunction(\"Elon\", \"Musk\") returns \"ElonMusk\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But you would notice there is no space between Elon and Musk, both are combined. Lets reconstruct the function to include space between the firstname and surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "  def myfullname(firstname, surname):\n",
    "     fullname = firstname + \" \" + surname\n",
    "     return fullname\n",
    " We add space by inserting double quote and spacin the first and last quotes.\n",

    "   => fullname = \"Elon Musk\"\n",
    "    finally the myfunction(\"Elon\", \"Musk\") returns \"Elon Musk\"\n",
    "\n",

    "The while loop functions in a similar way as the for loop.\n",
    "The difference is that, \n",

    "     An iterable is any item that contains multiple items which can be iterated or moved through. \n",
    "     Thus, an iterable contains more than one item. It could be a list or dictionary with one or more items.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the ending point of the while loop is specified directly just as the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate an example of while loop. We have 75 CBs, 130 CDs and 150 CEs.\n",
    "We are allocating rooms to these students. \n",
